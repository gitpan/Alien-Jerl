       Jerl allows perl to run within the JVM (not having to access any
       external libs).

   DDeettaaiillss
       Jerl allows perl to run within the JVM (not having to access any
       external libs). Perl has been virtualized to run within the JVM. The
       current implementation is a version of microperl.

           Jerl's purpose is merely to pull Perl into Java (no JNI/native Perl)
           Fun
           Not speed (see Inline::Java in Alternatives Below)
           Use Perl from a Jar

           nestedVM provided a straightforward means of recompilation
           MIPS running within Java is not fast, but there are alternatives for Perl Java integration if speed is a concern(see below)
           Implement project in a maintainable way so updates are not too time consuming

           For speed / optimization Inline::Java works
           Check CPAN.org, search Java (there may be something similar)
           Goto Perlmonks.org, search Java (there may be something similar)
