=head1 NAME

Alien::Jerl - micro perl running on JVM (MIPS Interpreter)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 java -jar ./lib/alien/jerl.jar --help 

 java -jar ./lib/alien/jerl.jar ./perl/fib.pl 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head2 Introduction

Jerl allows perl to run within the JVM (not having to access any external libs).

=head2 Details

Jerl allows perl to run within the JVM (not having to access any external libs). Perl has been virtualized to run within the JVM. The current implementation is a version of microperl. 

=head1 FAQ

     https://code.google.com/p/jerl/wiki/JERL_FAQ

=head2 Why

    Jerl's purpose is merely to pull Perl into Java (no JNI/native Perl)
    Fun
    Not speed (see Inline::Java in Alternatives Below)
    Use Perl from a Jar 

=head2 Why nestedVM / MIPS

    nestedVM provided a straightforward means of recompilation
    MIPS running within Java is not fast, but there are alternatives for Perl Java integration if speed is a concern(see below)
    Implement project in a maintainable way so updates are not too time consuming 

=head2 Isn't there something like this already

    For speed / optimization Inline::Java works
    Check CPAN.org, search Java (there may be something similar)
    Goto Perlmonks.org, search Java (there may be something similar) 

=head2 Jerl Alternatives (TIMTOWTDI)

    Perl's interface to JAVA Inline::Java
    --> http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=module&query=Inline::Java
    JPL: A deprecated means of accessing JAVA & Perl
    --> http://search.cpan.org/~gmpassos/PLJava-0.04/README.pod 

=head2 What Jars are required

    jerl.jar is required for jerl
    jerl_perlVM.jar is a wapper for interfacing with jerl via Java
    you may find both in the eclipse sample project

=head2 C<jerlVersion()>

C<jerlVersion()> returns the current version of jerl from the Jar and of this package (multi line)

=item JVM

A working JVM must be available for this to work properly
